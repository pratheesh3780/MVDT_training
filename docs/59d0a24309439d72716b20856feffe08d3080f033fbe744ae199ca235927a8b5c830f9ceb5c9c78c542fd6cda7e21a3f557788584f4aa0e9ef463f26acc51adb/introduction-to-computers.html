<p>A computer is an electronic device that stores, retrieves, processes and
manipulates data. It is an <em>electronic machine</em> that takes input from
the <em>user</em>, processes the given input and generates output in the form
of useful information.</p>

</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Computers can process data at an extremely fast rate.Computers need only a few seconds to complete a task that a normal human being may take days or even years to complete. Powerful computers are capable of performing billions of operations in one second.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accuracy</strong>: Computers generate accurate results. But faulty instructions may lead to faulty results. This condition is known as GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diligence</strong>: Being a machine computer does not suffer from human traits of tiredness and lack of concentration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reliability</strong>: A computer produces error-free results. At hardware level, it does not require any human intervention between its processing operations. Moreover, computers have built-in diagnostic capabilities, which help in continuous monitoring of the system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Storage capability</strong>: Computers can store large amounts of data and can recall the required information almost instantaneously. As the main memory of the computer is relatively small, data can be stored on secondary storage devices such as disks. The data stored in the disks can be accessed quickly for processing, as and when required.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Versatility</strong>: Computers are versatile in nature. They can easily perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, at one moment, it can be used to draft a letter, another moment it can be used to play music and in between, one can print a document as well. All this work is possible by changing the program (computer instructions).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Sharing</strong>: In the initial stages of development, computers were isolated machines. With the advancement of technologies, computers can be connected with each other. This has made the sharing of costly resources like printers possible. Apart from resource sharing, data and information can also be shared among groups of computers, thus creating a large information and knowledge base.</p></li>

</h2>
<p>The evolution of computers began with manual computing devices like the
Sand table and the Abacus, followed by automated computing devices like
the difference engine and the analytical engine. Charles Babbage, a
professor at the Cambridge University is considered to be the father of
modern computers.</p>

Were those used during the period
1937-1956. These used vacuum tubes technology for calculation, storage
and control purpose and so were invariably colossal. They were not
easily transferable due to their immense size and it was important to
always keep them in cool places. Dissipation of heat in large quantities
made these computers prone to frequent hardware faults. Although fast in
that time, they are the slowest when compared to the modern-day
computers. These computers carried out complex mathematical
computations efficiently and in a shorter span of time than when done
manually. The programming in these computers was done in machine
language (binary codes using 0 and 1).<br><div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>Multi-tasking using these
computers were impossible because they were generally designed as
special-purpose computers and could execute only one program at a time.
These computers were expensive to operate and used a large amount of
electricity. Some examples of first generation computers are ENIAC,
EDVAC, EDSAC and UNIVAC. Programming language used was machine code.
Punch cards and paper tapes served as the input device and output
devices. Magnetic tapes and Magnetic drums were the main memory.</p>

<p>These were usedÂ during the period 1956-1963.Â 
The logic circuits in them use transistors in place of vacuum tubes in
building the basic logic circuits.Â  They were the fastest computing
devices of their time; and were easier to program due to the use
ofÂ assembly language.Â  Assembly languages had to be translated into
machine codes, using assemblers so that it was easier for the computer
to process the codes. They couldÂ be transferred from one place to other
very easily because they were small and light.Â  Also, they required very
less power in carrying out their operations.Â  They were moreÂ reliable
than the first generation computers as they did not require maintenance
at regular intervals of time. Punched cards and magnetic tapes were the
input/output devices. Magnetic core, magnetic tapes and magnetic discs
were the main memory. Examples of computers in this generation are
UNIVAC 1107, IBM 1401</p>

<p>Brought huge gains in computational power.
Computers in this generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs), which are
semiconductor devices with several transistors built into one physical
component.Â  These devices wereÂ than the previous generation.Â  They could
be installed very easily and required less space.Â  Programming became
easier due to the use of high-level languages and any type of
application could be executed.Â  They areÂ easily transportable, more
reliable and require less frequent maintenance schedules.Â  Magnetic
tapes and discs served as the main storage memory. However, theÂ storage
capacity of these computers was still very small and theÂ performance of
these computers degraded while executing large applications, involving
complex computations because of the small storage capacity.Â Â The cost of
these computers was very high and they had to beÂ placed in
air-conditioned places.Â Â Input was given using keyboard and output
obtained via the monitor. Programs were written using Assembly language
and High Level language. E.g. UNIVAC 1108.</p>

<p>They used Large Scale Integration (LSI)
technology and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology.Â  The term
Personal Computer (PC) became known to the people during this era.Â 
These computers are very powerful in terms of their processing speed,
access time and storage capacity.Â  Semi-conductor memories like Random
Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) came into existence. They
are highly reliable and required very less maintenance.Â  They are very
user- friendly, versatile systems as the programs written on these
computers are highly portable.Â  They require very less power to
operate.Â  However, the soldering of LSI and VLSI chips on the wiring
board was not an easy task and required complicated technologies to bind
these chips on the wiring board.Â Â High level languages like Java,
Kotlin, C# were used for programming. Advanced input and output devices
were used e.g.Â optical readers, various types of keyboards, GUIâs,
paddles, joysticks, impact and non-impact printers, plotters. Computers
could be linked together to form networks. Databases could also be
created for data processing during this generation.</p>

<p>These are different types of modern
digital computers.Â  These use Ultra Large Scale Integration technology
that allows almost ten million electronic components to be fabricated on
one small chip.Â  They are the fastest and powerful computers till date.Â 
They have the capacity toÂ execute a large number of applications at the
same time and that too at a very high speed, thereby decreasing their
size.Â  This generation of computers use microprocessors for parallel
processing. They are extremely user-friendly and areÂ versatile for
communications and resource sharing.Â Â TheÂ <em>expert system</em>Â concept is
used in these systems. TheÂ <em>expert system</em>Â is defined as a computer
information system that attempts to mimic the thought process and
reasoning of experts in specific areas. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
refers to a series of related technologies that tries to simulate and
reproduce human behavior, including thinking, speaking and reasoning.
Most high level languages like C++. Java, Python, R can be used for
programming. Input/output devices are highly advanced and can use
Bluetooth technology and printers can be connected through wiFi
technology to communicate. Computers sizes have reduced considerably and
can be carried in the pockets. Example of fifth generation computers are
Smartphones, tablets, notebooks, laptops, desktops.</p>

<p><strong>Analog computers</strong>: represent data in the form of continuous electrical
signals having a specific magnitude.Â  They work on the principles of
measurement.Â Â They are very fast and allow several operations to be
carried out simultaneously. However, the results produced by these
computers are not very accurate. Therefore, the analog computers are
widely used in applications in which accuracy of results is not a major
concern. They are powerful tools to solve differential equations.</p>
<p><strong>Digital computers</strong>: store and process data in the digital form (0 and
1).Â Â The outputs produced by these computers are also in the digital
form. Digital computers are generally faster and more reliable than the
analog computer systems and provide more accurate results.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid computers</strong>: a combination of analog computer and digital computer
because it encompasses the best features of both. They use analog for
computation and digital for storage.Â Â These features make the hybrid
computers very fast, efficient and reliable. They are less expensive
than digital computers.</p>

<p><strong>Microcomputer</strong> was designed to be used by individuals.Â Â These computers
includeÂ Desktop Computers- which includes a box and a monitor on a
table;Â Â In-car computers (carputers)Â â which are built into a car, for
entertainment or navigation andÂ Game consoles- video games use computers
such as these.Â Â Smaller microcomputers are also calledÂ mobile computer
devices.Â  Some examples are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Laptops and portable computersÂ â Portable and all in one case.</p></li>
<li><p>Tablet Computer- Like laptops, but with a touch screen that replaces
the keyboard</p></li>
<li><p>Smartphones, smart-books, palmtop computers- Small handheld
computers with limited hardware</p></li>
<li><p>Programmable calculator - Like small handhelds, but specialized on
mathematical work.</p></li>
<li><p>Handheld game consoles- The same as game consoles, but small and
portable.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mini computers</strong> were developed in mid 60s.Â  They were also called
mid-range computers and used 16 bit processors.Â Â The mini computer is a
small digital computer whose process and storage capacity is lesser than
that of a mainframe, but more than that of micro-computer. Its speed of
processing data is in between that of a mainframe and a
micro-computer.Â Â Mini computerÂ is designed to meet the computing needs
for several people simultaneously in a small to medium-sized business
environment. It is capable of supporting form 4 to about 200
simultaneous users. It serves as a centralised storehouse for a cluster
of workstations or as a network server.</p>
<p><strong>mainframe computer</strong> is an ultra-high performance computer made for
high-volume, processor-intensive computing. It consists of a high-end
computer processor, with related peripheral devices, capable of
supporting large volumes of data processing, high performance online
transaction processing systems, and extensive data storage and
retrieval.Â  Mainframes are the second largest (in capability and size)
of the computer family, the largest being super computers. However,
mainframes can usually execute many programs simultaneously at a high
speed whereas super computers are designed for single process. Mainframe
computers are very large, expensive, powerful and can handle millions of
users at a time.Â  They can process immense data volumes quickly.Â  Their
speed is measured in MIPS (Millions of Instructions per
Second).Â Â Mainframe allows its user to maintain large information
storage at a centralized location and be able to access and process this
data from different computers located at different locations. It is
typically used by large businesses and for scientific purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Super computers</strong> are high speed computers with extremely high processing,
storage and computing capabilities.Â Â Super computers are the special
purpose machines. A super computer has the highest processing speed at a
given time for solving scientific and engineering problems. Essentially,
it contains a large number of CPUs that operate in parallel to make it
faster. Due to this feature, super computers are used in many
applications.Â Â A super computer can process a great deal of information
and make extensive calculations very quickly.Â Â Â Supercomputer processing
speeds are measured in floating point operations per second,
orÂ FLOPS.Â Â It can resolve complex mathematical equations in a few hours,
which would have taken a scientist with paper and pencil a lifetime, or
years, using a hand calculator. It is the fastest, costliest and the
most powerful computer available today. Typically, super computers are
used to solve complex mathematical problems. PARAM is a super computer
developed in India.</p>
