It is an electronic machine that takes input from the user, processes the given input and generates output in the form of useful information. 1.2 Characteristics Speed: Computers can process data at an extremely fast rate.Computers need only a few seconds to complete a task that a normal human being may take days or even years to complete. Powerful computers are capable of performing billions of operations in one second. Accuracy: Computers generate accurate results. But faulty instructions may lead to faulty results. This condition is known as GIGO (Garbage In Garbage Out). Diligence: Being a machine computer does not suffer from human traits of tiredness and lack of concentration. Reliability: A computer produces error-free results. At hardware level, it does not require any human intervention between its processing operations. Moreover, computers have built-in diagnostic capabilities, which help in continuous monitoring of the system. Storage capability: Computers can store large amounts of data and can recall the required information almost instantaneously. As the main memory of the computer is relatively small, data can be stored on secondary storage devices such as disks. The data stored in the disks can be accessed quickly for processing, as and when required. Versatility: Computers are versatile in nature. They can easily perform multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, at one moment, it can be used to draft a letter, another moment it can be used to play music and in between, one can print a document as well. All this work is possible by changing the program (computer instructions). Resource Sharing: In the initial stages of development, computers were isolated machines. With the advancement of technologies, computers can be connected with each other. This has made the sharing of costly resources like printers possible. Apart from resource sharing, data and information can also be shared among groups of computers, thus creating a large information and knowledge base. 1.3 Computer Evolution and Generations The evolution of computers began with manual computing devices like the Sand table and the Abacus, followed by automated computing devices like the difference engine and the analytical engine. Charles Babbage, a professor at the Cambridge University is considered to be the father of modern computers. 1.3.1 First Generation Computers Were those used during the period 1937-1956. These used vacuum tubes technology for calculation, storage and control purpose and so were invariably colossal. They were not easily transferable due to their immense size and it was important to always keep them in cool places. Dissipation of heat in large quantities made these computers prone to frequent hardware faults. Although fast in that time, they are the slowest when compared to the modern-day computers. These computers carried out complex mathematical computations efficiently and in a shorter span of time than when done manually. The programming in these computers was done in machine language (binary codes using 0 and 1). Figure 1.1: Vaccum tubes in first generation computer Multi-tasking using these computers were impossible because they were generally designed as special-purpose computers and could execute only one program at a time. These computers were expensive to operate and used a large amount of electricity. Some examples of first generation computers are ENIAC, EDVAC, EDSAC and UNIVAC. Programming language used was machine code. Punch cards and paper tapes served as the input device and output devices. Magnetic tapes and Magnetic drums were the main memory. Figure 1.2: Replacing a vaccum tube in ENIAC Figure 1.3: Magnetic drums Figure 1.4: Drum memory from the BESK computer Swedens first binary computer 1.3.2 Second Generation computers These were used during the period 1956-1963.  The logic circuits in them use transistors in place of vacuum tubes in building the basic logic circuits.  They were the fastest computing devices of their time; and were easier to program due to the use of assembly language.  Assembly languages had to be translated into machine codes, using assemblers so that it was easier for the computer to process the codes. They could be transferred from one place to other very easily because they were small and light.  Also, they required very less power in carrying out their operations.  They were more reliable than the first generation computers as they did not require maintenance at regular intervals of time. Punched cards and magnetic tapes were the input/output devices. Magnetic core, magnetic tapes and magnetic discs were the main memory. Examples of computers in this generation are UNIVAC 1107, IBM 1401 Figure 1.5: UNIVAC 1107 Figure 1.6: A transistor 1.3.3 Third Generation computers Brought huge gains in computational power. Computers in this generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs), which are semiconductor devices with several transistors built into one physical component.  These devices were than the previous generation.  They could be installed very easily and required less space.  Programming became easier due to the use of high-level languages and any type of application could be executed.  They are easily transportable, more reliable and require less frequent maintenance schedules.  Magnetic tapes and discs served as the main storage memory. However, the storage capacity of these computers was still very small and the performance of these computers degraded while executing large applications, involving complex computations because of the small storage capacity.  The cost of these computers was very high and they had to be placed in air-conditioned places.  Input was given using keyboard and output obtained via the monitor. Programs were written using Assembly language and High Level language. E.g. UNIVAC 1108. Figure 1.7: A third generation computer Figure 1.8: A third generation integrated circuit 1.3.4 Fourth Generation computers They used Large Scale Integration (LSI) technology and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology.  The term Personal Computer (PC) became known to the people during this era.  These computers are very powerful in terms of their processing speed, access time and storage capacity.  Semi-conductor memories like Random Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM) came into existence. They are highly reliable and required very less maintenance.  They are very user- friendly, versatile systems as the programs written on these computers are highly portable.  They require very less power to operate.  However, the soldering of LSI and VLSI chips on the wiring board was not an easy task and required complicated technologies to bind these chips on the wiring board.  High level languages like Java, Kotlin, C# were used for programming. Advanced input and output devices were used e.g. optical readers, various types of keyboards, GUI’s, paddles, joysticks, impact and non-impact printers, plotters. Computers could be linked together to form networks. Databases could also be created for data processing during this generation. Figure 1.9: A very large scale integrated circuit 1.3.5 Fifth Generation Computers These are different types of modern digital computers.  These use Ultra Large Scale Integration technology that allows almost ten million electronic components to be fabricated on one small chip.  They are the fastest and powerful computers till date.  They have the capacity to execute a large number of applications at the same time and that too at a very high speed, thereby decreasing their size.  This generation of computers use microprocessors for parallel processing. They are extremely user-friendly and are versatile for communications and resource sharing.  The expert system concept is used in these systems. The expert system is defined as a computer information system that attempts to mimic the thought process and reasoning of experts in specific areas. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a series of related technologies that tries to simulate and reproduce human behavior, including thinking, speaking and reasoning. Most high level languages like C++. Java, Python, R can be used for programming. Input/output devices are highly advanced and can use Bluetooth technology and printers can be connected through wiFi technology to communicate. Computers sizes have reduced considerably and can be carried in the pockets. Example of fifth generation computers are Smartphones, tablets, notebooks, laptops, desktops. Figure 1.10: An ultra large scale integrated circuit 1.3.6 Sixth Generation These computers uses lots of parallel computing.  This generation shows vast potential for improved wide area networking utilising the explosive increase in network bandwidths. Computer storage capacity has increased tremendously and Solid State Devices can be embedded in the computer for large storage space at cheaper and efficient rates. 1.4 Computer Classification Classification of computers can be made based on operating principles, applications, function, and size and capability 1.4.1 Based on operating principles Analog Digital  Hybrid Analog computers: represent data in the form of continuous electrical signals having a specific magnitude.  They work on the principles of measurement.  They are very fast and allow several operations to be carried out simultaneously. However, the results produced by these computers are not very accurate. Therefore, the analog computers are widely used in applications in which accuracy of results is not a major concern. They are powerful tools to solve differential equations. Digital computers: store and process data in the digital form (0 and 1).  The outputs produced by these computers are also in the digital form. Digital computers are generally faster and more reliable than the analog computer systems and provide more accurate results. Hybrid computers: a combination of analog computer and digital computer because it encompasses the best features of both. They use analog for computation and digital for storage.  These features make the hybrid computers very fast, efficient and reliable. They are less expensive than digital computers. 1.4.2 Based on application General purpose computers that can work in all environments. They are versatile and can store a number of programs meant for performing distinct tasks. However, they are not efficient and consume a large amount of time in generating a result. Special purpose computers that can perform only a specified task.  They are not versatile and their speed and memory size depend on the task that is to be performed. They are less expensive. They are efficient and consume less amount of time in generating the result. 1.4.3 Based on Size and Capability Microcomputers (Personal Computers) Mini Computers  Mainframe Computers Super Computers Microcomputer was designed to be used by individuals.  These computers include Desktop Computers- which includes a box and a monitor on a table;  In-car computers (carputers) – which are built into a car, for entertainment or navigation and Game consoles- video games use computers such as these.  Smaller microcomputers are also called mobile computer devices.  Some examples are: Laptops and portable computers – Portable and all in one case. Tablet Computer- Like laptops, but with a touch screen that replaces the keyboard Smartphones, smart-books, palmtop computers- Small handheld computers with limited hardware Programmable calculator - Like small handhelds, but specialized on mathematical work. Handheld game consoles- The same as game consoles, but small and portable. Mini computers were developed in mid 60s.  They were also called mid-range computers and used 16 bit processors.  The mini computer is a small digital computer whose process and storage capacity is lesser than that of a mainframe, but more than that of micro-computer. Its speed of processing data is in between that of a mainframe and a micro-computer.  Mini computer is designed to meet the computing needs for several people simultaneously in a small to medium-sized business environment. It is capable of supporting form 4 to about 200 simultaneous users. It serves as a centralised storehouse for a cluster of workstations or as a network server. mainframe computer is an ultra-high performance computer made for high-volume, processor-intensive computing. It consists of a high-end computer processor, with related peripheral devices, capable of supporting large volumes of data processing, high performance online transaction processing systems, and extensive data storage and retrieval.  Mainframes are the second largest (in capability and size) of the computer family, the largest being super computers. However, mainframes can usually execute many programs simultaneously at a high speed whereas super computers are designed for single process. Mainframe computers are very large, expensive, powerful and can handle millions of users at a time.  They can process immense data volumes quickly.  Their speed is measured in MIPS (Millions of Instructions per Second).  Mainframe allows its user to maintain large information storage at a centralized location and be able to access and process this data from different computers located at different locations. It is typically used by large businesses and for scientific purposes. Super computers are high speed computers with extremely high processing, storage and computing capabilities.  Super computers are the special purpose machines. A super computer has the highest processing speed at a given time for solving scientific and engineering problems. Essentially, it contains a large number of CPUs that operate in parallel to make it faster. Due to this feature, super computers are used in many applications.  A super computer can process a great deal of information and make extensive calculations very quickly.   Supercomputer processing speeds are measured in floating point operations per second, or FLOPS.  It can resolve complex mathematical equations in a few hours, which would have taken a scientist with paper and pencil a lifetime, or years, using a hand calculator. It is the fastest, costliest and the most powerful computer available today. Typically, super computers are used to solve complex mathematical problems. PARAM is a super computer developed in India. 1.4.4 Based on Function Servers Workstations Embedded computers Information Appliance Computers Servers A server is a computer that is dedicated to provide service to other computers on a network.       workstation was intended to serve a single user.  It can also be termed as a terminal at the user end of a computer network. Embedded computers are a part of a device and usually execute a program that is stored in the non-volatile memory of the system.  These computers exist in digital watches, MP3 players, traffic signals, avionics, microcontroller chip, factory controllers. Information Appliance computers are designed to exclusively perform a singular user-friendly task such as playing music, or photography or edit text.

In processing data, the CPU performs four basic steps: Fetch: Each instruction is stored in memory and has its own address. The processor takes this address number from the program counter, which is responsible for tracking which instructions the CPU should execute next. 2.1.1 Components of the CPU Control Unit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) Registers   Figure 2.1: Components of CPU Although the main memory was once considered to be part of the CPU, today as the boundaries shift, it has become a separate entity and the CPU now comprises of registers and cache memory for temporary storage of data.  2.1.1.1 Registers These are storage areas that store data, instructions and intermediate results temporarily.  They are not part of the memory and work under the direction of the Control Unit, so as to provide additional storage and enhance space speed. They provide information to other units of the computer when needed.  They accept, temporarily hold and transfer instructions and data, and help with the arithmetic and logic operations. The functions of these registers are: Storage of all the data and the instructions required for processing. Storage of intermediate results of processing. Storage of the final results of processing before these results are released to an output device. All inputs and outputs are transmitted through these registers The data/information stored in the registers are in the form of binary digits (bits), 0 and 1.  (8 bits = 1 byte) They are used for Instant Access Storage. These registers have been assigned specific names and related roles as follows: Accumulator – holds the instruction that is to be executed, the data to be manipulated and the results of computation Memory Address Register – to keep track of the active memory location Memory Buffer Register – to temporarily hold data or results taken from or to be placed in memory Program Control Register – holds the address of the next instruction that is to be accessed Input /Output Register – to communicate with the input/output devices General-Purpose Register – that is used for a variety of functions 2.1.1.2 Control Unit This unit has circuits that utilise electrical signals to controls the operations of all parts of the computer related to storage and execution of instructions, by communicating with the ALU and the memory.  However, it does not carry out any actual data processing operations. Functions of this unit are − It is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and instructions among other units of a computer. It manages and coordinates all the units of the computer. It obtains the instructions from the memory, interprets them, and directs the operation of the computer. It communicates with Input/ Output devices for transfer of data or results from storage. It does not process or store data. 2.1.1.3 ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) This unit contains circuits that perform both arithmetic and logical operations.  Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are the four arithmetic operations performed by the ALU.  The cost of the ALU increases as the operations performed by it becomes complex and more heat is dissipated.  Logical operations pertaining to comparisons between numbers, between letters or between characters are also performed by the ALU.  The ALU consists of two subsections namely, Arithmetic Unit Logic Unit 2.1.1.3.1 Arithmetic Unit Function of arithmetic section is to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, through bit-shifting operations.  All complex operations are done by making repetitive use of the above operations.  In some processors there is one arithmetic unit for fixed-point operations and another for floating point calculations.  2.1.1.3.2 Logic Unit Function of logic section is to perform logic operations such as comparing, selecting, matching, and merging of data.  Logical operations performed by the logical section are as follows: Equal-to condition (=). This is the test where two values are compared to check for equality. Less-than condition (&lt;). Comparison is made to check if value is less than the other. Greater-than condition (&gt;). In this case, two values are compared to check if one is greater than the other. Less than or equal to condition (&lt;=). Two values are checked to find if one is less than the other or atleast equal to it. Greater than or equal to (&gt;=).  Two values are compared to check if one is greater than the other or atleast equal to it. Not equal to (=).  Comparison between two values are made to show that they are not equal to each other. 2.2 Internal Communication of CPU Between CPU and the Memory - is connected by means of massive circuit board called motherboard and it contain small parts called buses which perform special functions Between the CPU and the Input/Output Devices - is also connected by buses and CU performs an important function "],["references.html", "Chapter 3 References", " Chapter 3 References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
