# Hardware- Central Processing Unit

## The central processing unit (CPU)  
CPU is the computer component that is
responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the
other hardware and software of the system. It is considered to be the
brain of the computer as most of the processing work is done here.  CPU
performs all types of data processing operations, stores data,
intermediate results and instructions (program), and controls the
operation of all parts of the computer.  It relies on a chipset located
on the motherboard.  This chipset containing millions of tiny
transistors that manipulate data that is being input into the computer. 
The measurement used to compute speed of a CPU is Hertz.  The speed of
the CPU is determined by a clock cycle, which means number of pulses per
second.  When there are more number of pulses/second, the processor is
capable of processing more data. 

CPU also has cache memory that is a buffer between the RAM and the
processor.  The cache memory stores the most frequently used data and
instructions for immediate access and helps to reduce average data
access time from the main memory.  Some CPUs have multiple processors on
a single chip and are called microprocessors. 

  **Computer Type**                          **Speed**
  ------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Personal Computers                         Mega Hertz (MHz) and Giga Hertz (GHz)
  WorkStations/Mini Computers / Mainframes   Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) and Billions of Instructions Per Second (BIPS)
  Super Computers                            Millions of FLoating point Operations Per Second (MFLOPS), Billions of FLOPS called GFLOPS and TeraFLOPS, (TFLOPS = 10^12^)

   
### Types of processors  

Processors are manufactured by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
and so these are the only two types of computer processors available in
the market today.  Intel\'s desktop **CPUs** include Celeron, Pentium
and Core.  Based on expression of information they can be either 32 bit
or 64 bit.  Three types of processors are:

-   Complex Instruction Set Computer architecture (CISC) that have large
    instruction sets, variable length instructions and varied addressing
    modes

-   Reduced Instruction Set Computer architecture (RISC)-- which have
    smaller instruction sets and place extra demand on the programmers

-   Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) -- this permits the
    processor to perform operations in a parallel fashion

The CPU performs Arithmetic operations, extracts data from memory and
executes commands. In processing data,
the **CPU** performs **four** basic steps: Fetch: Each instruction is
stored in memory and has its own address. The **processor** takes this
address number from the program counter, which is responsible for
tracking which instructions the **CPU** should execute next.

### Components of the CPU  

-   Control Unit

-   ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

-   Registers

``` 

Although the main memory was once considered to be part of the CPU,
today as the boundaries shift, it has become a separate entity and the
CPU now comprises of registers and cache memory for temporary storage of
data. 

#### Registers  

These are storage areas that store data, instructions and intermediate
results temporarily.  They are not part of the memory and work under the
direction of the Control Unit, so as to provide additional storage and
enhance space speed. They provide information to other units of the
computer when needed.  They accept, temporarily hold and transfer
instructions and data, and help with the arithmetic and logic
operations. The functions of these registers are:

-   Storage of all the data and the instructions required for
    processing.

-   Storage of intermediate results of processing.

-   Storage of the final results of processing before these results are
    released to an output device.

-   All inputs and outputs are transmitted through these registers

The data/information stored in the registers are in the form of binary
digits (bits), 0 and 1.  (8 bits = 1 byte)

They are used for Instant Access Storage. These registers have been
assigned specific names and related roles as follows:

-   *Accumulator* -- holds the instruction that is to be executed, the
    data to be manipulated and the results of computation

-   *Memory Address Register* -- to keep track of the active memory
    location

-   *Memory Buffer Register* -- to temporarily hold data or results
    taken from or to be placed in memory

-   *Program Control Register *-- holds the address of the next
    instruction that is to be accessed

-   *Input /Output Register --* to communicate with the input/output
    devices

-   *General-Purpose Register* -- that is used for a variety of
    functions

#### Control Unit  

This unit has circuits that utilise electrical signals to controls the
operations of all parts of the computer related to storage and execution
of instructions, by communicating with the ALU and the memory.  However,
it does not carry out any actual data processing operations.

Functions of this unit are −

-   It is responsible for controlling the transfer of data and
    instructions among other units of a computer.

-   It manages and coordinates all the units of the computer.

-   It obtains the instructions from the memory, interprets them, and
    directs the operation of the computer.

-   It communicates with Input/ Output devices for transfer of data or
    results from storage.

-   It does not process or store data.

#### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)  

This unit contains circuits that perform both arithmetic and logical
operations.  Addition, subtraction, division and multiplication are the
four arithmetic operations performed by the ALU.  The cost of the ALU
increases as the operations performed by it becomes complex and more
heat is dissipated.  Logical operations pertaining to comparisons
between numbers, between letters or between characters are also
performed by the ALU.  The ALU consists of two subsections namely,

-   Arithmetic Unit

-   Logic Unit

##### Arithmetic Unit  

Function of arithmetic section is to perform arithmetic operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, through
bit-shifting operations.  All complex operations are done by making
repetitive use of the above operations.  In some processors there is one
arithmetic unit for fixed-point operations and another for floating
point calculations. 

##### Logic Unit  

Function of logic section is to perform logic operations such as
comparing, selecting, matching, and merging of data.  Logical operations
performed by the logical section are as follows:

-   *Equal-to condition*** (=).** This is the test where two values are
    compared to check for equality.

-   *Less-than condition*** (\<).** Comparison is made to check if value
    is less than the other.

-   *Greater-than condition*** (\>).** In this case, two values are
    compared to check if one is greater than the other.

-   *Less than or equal to condition*** (\<=).** Two values are checked
    to find if one is less than the other or atleast equal to it.

-   *Greater than or equal to*** (\>=).**  Two values are compared to
    check if one is greater than the other or atleast equal to it.

-   *Not equal to ***(=).**  Comparison between two values are made to
    show that they are not equal to each other.

## Internal Communication of CPU  

-   Between CPU and the Memory - is connected by means of massive
    circuit board called motherboard and it contain small parts called
    buses which perform special functions  
    
-   Between the CPU and the Input/Output Devices - is also connected by
    buses and CU performs an important function
