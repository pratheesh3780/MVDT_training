# Importing data files in R {#import}

In the previous chapter we have discussed the very basics of R
programming including installation, launching, basic data types and
arithmetic functions. Here, you will learn how to import data into R. It
is important to ensure that your data is well prepared before importing
it into R to avoid errors.

## Preparing your file

-   File can be prepared in MS Excel

-   Use the first row as column headers (or column names). Generally,
    columns represent variables.

-   Use the first column as row names. Generally rows represent
    observations.

-   Make sure each row name is unique. But this is not in case of
    analysis of experiments , there each row name is treatment name,
    which should be repeated for each replication

Column names should be compatible with R naming conventions.

### Naming conventions:

-   Avoid names with blank spaces. Bad column name `Sepal width`; Good
    convention `Sepal_width`

-   Avoid names with special symbols: ?, \$, \*, +, #, (, ), -, /, }, {,
    \|, \>, \< etc. Only underscore can be used.

-   Avoid beginning variable names with a number. Use letter instead.
    Good column names: obs_100m or x100m. Bad column name: 100m

-   Column names must be unique. Duplicated names are not allowed.

-   R is case sensitive. This means that Name, NAME and name, naMe all
    are treated as different.

-   Avoid blank rows in your data

-   Delete any comments in your file

-   Replace missing values by NA (denotes **N**ot **A**vailable)

-   If you have a column containing date, use the four digit format.
    Good format: 01/01/2016. Bad format: 01/01/16

A final good looking file  

```{r goodfile, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='An example file',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/import/data1c4.png"))
```


### Saving file  

I recommend you to save your file in .csv (comma separated value file)
format.

**Why CSV?**

The usual file we save in MS Excel will be saved as XLS files or XLSX
files. Workbook files for Microsoft Excel from 97 to 2003 are known as
XLS files. The XLSX extension is used by later versions of Excel. All of
the data from the worksheets in a workbook, including formatting,
charts, graphics, calculations, and more, is contained in the XLS and
XLSX file formats.

The Comma Separated Values (CSV) format is a plain text format in which
values are separated by commas, whereas the Excel Sheets binary file
format (XLS) contains information on all of the worksheets in a file,
including both content and formatting. Any spreadsheet programme,
including Microsoft Excel, Open Office, Google Sheets, etc., can open
CSV files. A straightforward text editor can also be used to open CSV
files. Because it is straightforward and compatible with the majority of
platforms, it is a very prevalent and well-liked file format for storing
and accessing data. But there are certain drawbacks to this simplicity.
CSV files can only contain a single sheet without any formatting or
formulas.

While CSV files are supported by almost all data upload interfaces,
Excel (XLS and XLSX) file types are preferable for storing more
complicated data. The CSV file format may be more advantageous if you
intend to move your data between platforms or export and import it
between interfaces.

### How to save as csv

Under the \"File name\" section in the \"Save As\" tab, you can select
\"Save as type\" and change it to \"CSV (Comma delimited) (\*.csv).  

```{r saving, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='How to save as csv',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/import/data2c4.png"))
```  

```{r saving1, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='How to save as csv (1)',out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/import/data3c4.png"))
```


## Importing Data set in Rstudio

To import a csv file in Rstudio

click on `File` then click on `Import Dataset` then select `from Text (base)`  

```{r saving2, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Importing data set',out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/import/data4c4.png"))
```    

Select the file and click open  

```{r saving3, echo=FALSE,fig.cap='Import Dataset dialogue box',out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/import/data5c4.png"))
```    

In the *Import Dataset* dialogue box you can change the name of the
dataset in the Box under `Name`. Heading radio button will be default
'yes'. Click on `import`. The dataset will be now imported and ready to
work on.

### Alternate methods

#### Importing csv files  

Data can be also imported using read.csv() function in R.
read.csv(\'path to the file\')  

```{r} 

# example

my_data<-read.csv(file = 'csv/usarrests.csv')

# here now the data set usarrests.csv stored in folder csv is stored in the name my_data

# You can now directly do operations on the my_data

summary(my_data)

``` 

#### Importing excel files  

To import from xlsx file, we need the package xlsx  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(xlsx)  

df <-read.xlsx("path/file.xlsx", n)

# n is n-th worksheet to import
```
